# 1v1 Demolition

1v1 Demolition is a simple 3D Racing Brawling Game developed by Ángel González and Gerard Romeu, two 2nd year students of the Bachelor Degree in Video Game Design and Development at UPC CITM/TTC, Barcelona. It has been made from scratch in C++ with Visual Studio using the OpenGL and Bullet libraries.



# Goal of the Game

The goal of the game is, by the use of projectiles, destroy the other player's vehicle.  The first player to destroy the opponent's vehicle 3 times wins.



# Game Mechanics

Each player starts with 3 lives. A life is subtracted when a player is hitted by the opponent's projectiles. When the amount of lives reach 0, the player loses and is reset back to the starting position.

Each player starts with 4 projectiles and, once shot, they need to be recharged by reaching the nearest "ammo pack". 

Player 1's projectiles are blue in colour and Player 2's are red. These colors change when the projectiles hit the opposing player (to red and blue respectively). 

Projectiles that have changed colours are harmless to the players. Those who have not, however, can still damage them.

If for whatever reason a vehicle is flipped over, each player has a specific input key assigned to flip their vehicle back to its original state.

Normal acceleration (W/8) makes the vehicle move slowly, and turbo (LSHIFT/ KP Plus) propels the vehicle forward,
